Overview
*********

This package can be used as part of an experimental workflow to record inputs and outputs, trigger events such as the start of a trial, or draw and manipulate what is seen on a computer screen. Every unique version of an experiment can be defined in a task file, which will create the data structures and methods necessary. Here we will outline some of the supported features for task creation.

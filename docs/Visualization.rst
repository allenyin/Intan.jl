Overview
*********

The current Opal Kelly and Intan recording hardware allow for a few or a few thousand channels of electrophysiological signal to be recorded from simultaneously. The user must be able to quickly assess the quality of the incoming signals and the performance of the automatic spike sorting routines. The main visualization displays of Intan.jl allows the user to view a signal channel at a time and multiple channels at once.

***********************
Single Channel Display
***********************

The left display shows voltage-time plots of detected spike events. The scroll bar to the left can be used to increase or decrease the gain of the display. The scroll bar to the bottom can be used to select the individual channel from the group display (to the right) to display.

Different clusters are represented with different colors.

Multi-channel Display

Overview
*********

The current Opal Kelly and Intan recording hardware allow for a few or a few thousand channels of electrophysiological signal to be recorded from simultaneously. The user must be able to quickly assess the quality of the incoming signals and the performance of the automatic spike sorting routines. The main visualization displays of Intan.jl allows the user to view a signal channel at a time and multiple channels at once.

Interface

=======================
Single Channel Display
=======================

The left display shows voltage-time plots of detected spike events. The scroll bar at the bottom can be used to select the individual channel from the group display (to the right) to display.

Different clusters are represented with different colors.

======================
Multi-channel Display
======================

The right display shows voltage-time plots of 16 channels simultaneously. The scroll bar at the bottom can be used to select which group of sixteen channels to display. This will reset the left display to the first channel in this group.

Different clusters are represented with different colors.
